3
00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.735
Beatrice.

4
00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:55.815
You were my first kiss.

5
00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:57.405
Beatrice, wait.

6
00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:58.985
Wait! Wait!

7
00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:00.075
Beatrice!

8
00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:32.715
What the hell
are you doing here?

9
00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:43.805
Better?

10
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.545
- Hi, Julia.
- Princeton was great.

11
00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.635
I'm back in town,
let's try to grab sushi.

12
00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:03.675
Hope all is well.

13
00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:07.135
I've come down with the flu
and am catching up on sleep.

14
00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:10.585
I'll call you when I'm
feeling better.

15
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:19.235
- Julianne... Um, Julia.
- It's Gabriel.

16
00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:21.405
I'm standing outside
your building.

17
00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:22.985
I wish we could go back
to this morning,

18
00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:26.155
and I could tell you that
I've never seen anything

19
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:29.495
more beautiful than you
in my kitchen, happy.

20
00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:32.335
That I'm incredibly lucky
that your rescued me

21
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.495
and... and stayed with me
all night.

22
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.125
That I'm an idiot,

23
00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:39.965
and I don't deserve
your kindness.

24
00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:41.755
I should never have
let you go this morning.

25
00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:46.015
I should have begged you
to stay.

26
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:49.475
I know I hurt you...

27
00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:51.415
and I'm sorry.

28
00:05:03.015 --> 00:05:04.365
Please, Julia,

29
00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:07.475
we need to talk about your note.

30
00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:14.025
There are things
I need to explain to you.

31
00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:20.925
I want to fix this.

32
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:24.035
Please. Call me.

33
00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:30.725
I left something on your porch.

34
00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:33.295 line:5%
Did you see it?

35
00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:36.665
Did you read the card?

36
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.635
I want to make it all up to you.

37
00:05:45.265 --> 00:05:51.185
I remember kissing you.
You kissed me back.

38
00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.975
Didn't you feel it?

39
00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:07.425
There is something between us.

40
00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:10.675
You can't expect me to
uncover your true identity

41
00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:13.055
and not talk to you about it.

42
00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:17.005
All I'm asking for is
one conversation.

43
00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:21.005
You owe me that much.

44
00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:25.025
Dr. Emerson,

45
00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:26.075
Stop harassing me.

46
00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:30.615 line:5%
I don't want you anymore.
I don't even want to know you.

47
00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:32.155
If you don't leave me alone,

48
00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:36.165
I'll be forced to file
a harassment claim against you.

49
00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:38.335
I need a new thesis director.

50
00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:41.715
Regards,
Miss Julia. H. Mitchell.

51
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:47.925
P.S. I'll be returning
the M.P. Emerson bursary.

52
00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:50.975 line:5%
Congratulations,
Professor Abelard.

53
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.675 line:5%
No one has ever made me feel

54
00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:56.995
as cheap as you did
Sunday morning.

55
00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:18.575
I understand you're

56
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.835
angry and hurt...

57
00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:24.965
and I'm the cause of
your pain, but...

58
00:07:24.985 --> 00:07:29.535
that bursary was given to you
because you deserve it.

59
00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:34.165
Don't punish me by
punishing yourself.

60
00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:38.765
I've found you a new advisor.

61
00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:42.775
Professor Katherine Picton
is a friend of mine.

62
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.255
She's agreed to meet you.

63
00:07:46.835 --> 00:07:50.595
I'm sorry you don't want to
know me anymore.

64
00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:53.655
Abelard truly cared for Heloise.

65
00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:58.875
He also hurt her,
as I have hurt you.

66
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.205
But he was deeply sorry.

67
00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:02.545
Read Abelard's sixth letter

68
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:06.965
and see if that alters your
perception of him and me.

69
00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.545
I'll spend the rest of my life

70
00:08:08.575 --> 00:08:13.455
regretting the fact that I wasted
my second chance to know you.

71
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:21.415
I will always be
conscious of your absence.

72
00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:27.215
I won't bother you again.

73
00:08:32.675 --> 00:08:34.735
Goodbye...

74
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:36.555
Julianne.

75
00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:47.935
Bastard!

76
00:09:47.965 --> 00:09:51.155
Hey, gorgeous. Whoa.
Didn't mean to scare you.

77
00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:53.775
- What's that?
- Junk mail.

78
00:09:53.805 --> 00:09:56.035
Looking forward to
Emerson's seminar?

79
00:09:56.055 --> 00:09:57.785
- Should be good.
- I don't know about that.

80
00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:59.075
He's been in a foul mood
for days.

81
00:09:59.095 --> 00:10:02.285
I don't want a repeat of what
happened last time he was like this.

82
00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:06.395
I, uh, got you something
from Princeton.

83
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:13.675
Please don't give it back.

84
00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:15.925
I know you don't have
a nice key ring, and...

85
00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:20.385
I wanted you to know I was
thinking of you while I was gone.

86
00:10:20.415 --> 00:10:23.095
Thank you, Paul.

87
00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:25.335
I missed you too.

88
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.675
You're welcome, Rabbit.

89
00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:50.955
Maybe we can grab coffee after?

90
00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:54.365
Sure, that sounds great.

91
00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.505
Miss Mitchell.

92
00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:13.635
I need to speak with you
after class.

93
00:11:17.425 --> 00:11:19.025
Please.

94
00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:22.785
Sorry, Professor,
I have an urgent meeting right after class

95
00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:24.615
that I can't miss.

96
00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:25.915
Of course.

97
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.575
Please e-mail me
and set up a time.

98
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.165
Of course, Professor.

99
00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:32.985
Another time.

100
00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:37.865
Today, I will be...

101
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.805
Today, I will be examining

102
00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:51.335
the relationship between
Dante and Beatrice.

103
00:11:51.465 --> 00:11:56.895
Particularly,
what transpired when Dante met Beatrice

104
00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:01.885
the second time
and she rejected him.

105
00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:09.335
Beatrice represents many things
for Dante.

106
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:11.935
They meet twice.

107
00:12:13.145 --> 00:12:16.835
My question is...

108
00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:18.255
where was Beatrice,

109
00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:23.995
and what was she doing in between
her two meetings with Dante?

110
00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:28.095
Dante waited years for her.

111
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:31.095
She knew where he lived.

112
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.565
She knew his family.

113
00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:36.675
She was friendly with them.

114
00:12:38.135 --> 00:12:39.355
If she cared about him,

115
00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:44.475
why did she make no attempt
to contact him?

116
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:57.275
I would say that
the answer is obvious.

117
00:12:58.195 --> 00:13:00.505
Dante cared for Beatrice,

118
00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:04.925
but Beatrice cared nothing
for Dante.

119
00:13:04.955 --> 00:13:09.835
Their relationship was
entirely one-sided.

120
00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:31.375
Yes, Miss Mitchell.

121
00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:33.075
This assessment of Beatrice

122
00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:37.455
is really arrogant and
self serving, professor.

123
00:13:37.485 --> 00:13:39.085
Are you crazy?

124
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:40.675
Why blame Beatrice?

125
00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.715
She's the victim in all of this.

126
00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:44.925
Dante met her when she was
under eighteen.

127
00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:47.595
It wasn't possible for them
to be together,

128
00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:48.595
unless he's a pedophile.

129
00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:53.305
Are you telling us that Dante
is a pedophile, professor?

130
00:13:53.335 --> 00:13:55.605
Of course not.

131
00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:58.395
He had true affection for her.

132
00:13:58.425 --> 00:14:03.615
If she had ever had
the courage to ask him,

133
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.775
he would have told her that.

134
00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:08.405
Everything in Dante's later life
revolves around sex.

135
00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:12.415
He certainly isn't sitting at
home alone on a Saturday night

136
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:13.455
waiting for Beatrice.

137
00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:17.455
So he must have not
cared for her.

138
00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:21.045
He needed companionship,
Miss Mitchell.

139
00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:25.385
And if it makes it
any more... palatable,

140
00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:28.805
those women were just
helpful friends.

141
00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.055
Friends?

142
00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:32.385
More like pelvic affiliates.

143
00:14:32.415 --> 00:14:33.595
Friends help each other.

144
00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:35.055
They don't feed
sexual addiction.

145
00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:38.815
His love for Beatrice
never diminished.

146
00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:42.105
He simply despaired
waiting for her to show up.

147
00:14:42.135 --> 00:14:44.525
And that was her fault.
Not his.

148
00:14:44.555 --> 00:14:47.715
If that's love,
I'll take hatred.

149
00:14:49.345 --> 00:14:51.495
I think you've made your point,
Miss Mitchell.

150
00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:54.535
Oh, I don't think I have.

151
00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:57.035
It's commonly known that
Dante's dalliances

152
00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.165
were anonymous and tawdry.

153
00:14:58.185 --> 00:15:00.915
That doesn't sound like someone
who would appeal to Beatrice.

154
00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:05.365
Not to mention the fact that
he has a mistress named Paulina.

155
00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:09.905
Paulina?
Who's Paulina?

156
00:15:10.905 --> 00:15:11.635
Um, uh...

157
00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:14.845
A woman in Philadelphia found
evidence of that relationship.

158
00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:19.605
Anyway, if Beatrice didn't want
Dante and rejected him,

159
00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:21.105
it was justified.

160
00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:25.735
Dante was a self-absorbed,
cruel, arrogant slut

161
00:15:25.755 --> 00:15:30.765
who treated women like toys
for his own personal amusement.

162
00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:49.005
The language Dante uses

163
00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:53.555
for his first meeting
with Beatrice is dreamlike.

164
00:15:53.575 --> 00:15:56.535
For personal reasons...

165
00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:06.835
For personal reasons,
he doesn't trust his senses.

166
00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:09.195
He's not sure who she is.

167
00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:15.535
One theory is Dante thought
Beatrice was...

168
00:16:15.555 --> 00:16:17.185
an angel.

169
00:16:18.225 --> 00:16:23.455
Beatrice is wrong in assuming
that he remembered everything

170
00:16:23.485 --> 00:16:24.625
from their first meeting.

171
00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:29.005
Wouldn't seeing her again
jar his memory?

172
00:16:29.025 --> 00:16:31.215
Or was he too drunk to try?

173
00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:32.385
That's enough.

174
00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:35.095
Can we get back to this
Paulina mistress?

175
00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:37.885
Paulina is irrelevant
and has no real bearing on

176
00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:39.725
today's discussion,
Miss Peterson.

177
00:16:39.745 --> 00:16:41.855
I disagree.
She was either

178
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.675
his mistress or his fuck buddy.

179
00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:46.525
Class is dismissed!

180
00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:49.445
In my office,
Miss Mitchell. Now!

181
00:17:12.695 --> 00:17:16.515
If you were anyone else,
I'd have you expelled.

182
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.555
Your disrespectful attitude
is unacceptable.

183
00:17:19.575 --> 00:17:22.765
On top of that,
I can't even begin to express

184
00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:26.735
the anger I have over
what you said about Paulina.

185
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:30.945
You are never to
speak about her again.

186
00:17:30.965 --> 00:17:33.215
Do I make myself clear?

187
00:17:34.515 --> 00:17:37.635
Do I make myself clear?

188
00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:41.145
Yes.

189
00:17:44.685 --> 00:17:48.165
I think you wanted me to
lose my temper and make a scene,

190
00:17:48.195 --> 00:17:50.295
so you'd be justified
in running way.

191
00:17:50.315 --> 00:17:54.425
You wanted me to behave like
every other abusive asshole

192
00:17:54.445 --> 00:17:55.595
that has knocked you around.

193
00:17:55.615 --> 00:17:57.845
Well, I'm not
an abusive asshole.

194
00:17:57.865 --> 00:18:03.855
What happened today in my class
will never happen again.

195
00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.395
Understand?

196
00:18:06.415 --> 00:18:08.565
I'll apologize to the class.

197
00:18:08.585 --> 00:18:09.695
You will do no such thing.

198
00:18:09.715 --> 00:18:13.565
That would only bring more
attention to us and lead to gossip.

199
00:18:13.595 --> 00:18:16.425
Gossip neither one of us wants.

200
00:18:19.895 --> 00:18:21.035
Is this a game to you?

201
00:18:21.055 --> 00:18:23.205
You left a bra in my mailbox.

202
00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:24.535
- I thought...
- Use your head!

203
00:18:24.565 --> 00:18:27.735
I wasn't about to
leave it on your porch.

204
00:18:28.895 --> 00:18:32.085
I started this clusterfuck
by changing my lecture,

205
00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:36.255
but you finished it with the
equivalent of a hydrogen bomb.

206
00:18:36.285 --> 00:18:39.715
We're going to pretend
this debacle never happened,

207
00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:41.135
and hope that the other students

208
00:18:41.165 --> 00:18:46.435
are too wrapped up in their
own lives to notice anything.

209
00:18:46.455 --> 00:18:49.415
Have you returned the bursary?

210
00:18:49.585 --> 00:18:51.395
- No.
- Good. And you won't.

211
00:18:51.425 --> 00:18:55.445
Returning it now will only draw
criticism for the both of us.

212
00:18:55.465 --> 00:18:57.715
Take the money.

213
00:19:09.145 --> 00:19:12.735
Did you listen to any of
the messages I left?

214
00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.915
But you don't believe me.

215
00:19:25.795 --> 00:19:27.185
You seem to be the only person

216
00:19:27.205 --> 00:19:29.895
capable of pushing
all my buttons,

217
00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:32.875
and I do mean all of them.

218
00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.135
Look at me.

219
00:19:47.725 --> 00:19:51.145
Why can't you just tell me
what you want, Julianne?

220
00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.445
Or do you only answer to Rabbit?

221
00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:08.185
Fine. I give up.

222
00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:10.955
Paul can have you.

223
00:20:42.655 --> 00:20:46.385
So all of this agony
was for nothing?

224
00:20:46.415 --> 00:20:48.805
- You were cruel.
- So were you.

225
00:20:48.835 --> 00:20:53.205
- You hurt me.
- And you hurt me.

226
00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:58.465
Is revenge everything
you dreamed it might be?

227
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:17.965
You're a coward.

228
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.215
I'm not a coward.

229
00:21:19.235 --> 00:21:20.545
You're the one who's leaving.

230
00:21:20.575 --> 00:21:22.255
You're sending me to him.

231
00:21:22.275 --> 00:21:24.295
Like hell I am.

232
00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.425
I'm just a student.

233
00:21:25.455 --> 00:21:27.595
You have all the power,
you could destroy me.

234
00:21:27.615 --> 00:21:32.055
You think I'd destroy you?
After our history?

235
00:21:32.085 --> 00:21:34.395
You think this is what I want?

236
00:21:34.415 --> 00:21:35.185
I'm miserable.

237
00:21:35.215 --> 00:21:38.735
Seeing you again after all this
time and seeing you like this?

238
00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:40.315
You never gave me a chance.

239
00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:41.905
How the hell would I know
what you want

240
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:43.365
when you won't fucking
talk to me?!

241
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:47.345
Shouting at me won't
persuade me to talk to you!

242
00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:59.405
Tell me that you want me,
or get out.

243
00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:07.035
I've never wanted anyone else.

244
00:23:17.685 --> 00:23:19.085
Darling, you all right?

245
00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:21.275
I think so.

246
00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:35.785
Beatrice.

247
00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:40.255
This is wrong.

248
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:43.195
You're my professor.

249
00:23:43.215 --> 00:23:45.445
I'm going to protect you.

250
00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:48.095
I promise you.

251
00:23:49.465 --> 00:23:51.595
Come with me.

252
00:23:55.595 --> 00:23:57.745
- Paul's waiting.
- Fuck Paul.

253
00:23:57.765 --> 00:23:59.625
He's my only friend in Toronto.

254
00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:02.565
I'd like to be your friend.

255
00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:06.835
Gabriel, this is dangerous.

256
00:24:06.865 --> 00:24:10.795
I love the way you
say my name, Beatrice.

257
00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.805
I'm not Beatrice.

258
00:24:12.825 --> 00:24:15.425
These delusions have to stop.

259
00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:22.455
Julianne, I've waited
six years to talk to you.

260
00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:26.295
I won't wait any longer.

261
00:24:27.545 --> 00:24:31.425
I'm taking you home...
with me.

262
00:24:41.525 --> 00:24:44.165
What are you doing?

263
00:24:44.195 --> 00:24:46.355
I'm texting Paul.

264
00:24:47.775 --> 00:24:49.525
To cancel.

265
00:25:47.005 --> 00:25:48.565
I'm going to make dinner,

266
00:25:48.585 --> 00:25:52.505
but I need to step out
and pick up a few things.

267
00:25:54.055 --> 00:25:56.015
Will you be all right?

268
00:25:59.645 --> 00:26:01.475
Of course.

269
00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:04.565
Promise me you won't leave.

270
00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:11.155
I promise.

271
00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:30.695
Julianne.

272
00:27:39.365 --> 00:27:40.995
Come.

273
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.525
Are you pleased?

274
00:27:56.545 --> 00:27:59.095
It's beautiful.

275
00:28:02.135 --> 00:28:03.765
Allow me.

276
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:35.685
My dear Julianne,

277
00:28:35.715 --> 00:28:39.155
if you wish to know
how I feel about you,

278
00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:40.655
just ask me.

279
00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:42.925
Yours, Gabriel.

280
00:29:21.555 --> 00:29:23.325
No champagne?

281
00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:26.695
You might find this
hard to believe, but...

282
00:29:26.725 --> 00:29:29.355
I don't drink all the time.

283
00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:32.665
We'll save the rest
for mimosas tomorrow.

284
00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:34.415
Breakfast?

285
00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:37.895
You're very sure of
yourself, Casanova.

286
00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:42.695
Your virtue is safe with me.

287
00:30:13.055 --> 00:30:16.525
I won't let your darkness
consume me.

288
00:30:25.325 --> 00:30:28.825
So you think darkness
can consume light?

289
00:30:29.455 --> 00:30:31.995
That's an interesting theory.

290
00:30:37.205 --> 00:30:40.395
I just threw some of my
darkness on those candles,

291
00:30:40.425 --> 00:30:42.275
and nothing happened.

292
00:30:42.295 --> 00:30:44.405
Don't be so damned
condescending.

293
00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:46.575
You know what I mean.

294
00:30:46.595 --> 00:30:49.655
Julianne, I won't lie to you
and say that

295
00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:52.685
I'm not attracted to
your luminosity.

296
00:30:55.015 --> 00:30:57.975
But I have no wish
to consume you.

297
00:31:00.105 --> 00:31:02.855
If I am the darkness, then...

298
00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:06.195
Then you're the stars.

299
00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:13.075
I won't let you fuck me.

300
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:16.745
I would never fuck you.

301
00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:21.585
One doesn't fuck an angel.

302
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:28.805
Then what does someone like you
do with an angel?

303
00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:32.935
Someone like me
would cherish her.

304
00:31:35.605 --> 00:31:38.165
Try to get to know her.

305
00:31:38.185 --> 00:31:41.695
Start by being friends, perhaps.

306
00:31:42.815 --> 00:31:47.135
Is it too hard to believe that
I want to take my time?

307
00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:49.615
That I want to know you?

308
00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:53.285
Yes.

309
00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:58.335
Julianne, this is new to me.

310
00:31:58.915 --> 00:32:03.335
Your prejudice is warranted
to some degree, but...

311
00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:06.845
But don't deliberately
try my patience.

312
00:32:34.915 --> 00:32:38.535
I know you're partial
to chocolate.

313
00:32:47.335 --> 00:32:49.885
You need to let me feed you.

314
00:32:52.305 --> 00:32:53.575
I'm not a child.

315
00:32:53.595 --> 00:32:56.475
Then stop acting like one.

316
00:32:57.935 --> 00:33:01.475
Trust me. Please.

317
00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:17.455
Mmmmm.

318
00:33:21.335 --> 00:33:22.995
Mmm.

319
00:33:34.425 --> 00:33:40.725
The act of feeding someone is the
ultimate act of care and affection.

320
00:33:41.265 --> 00:33:46.235
Sharing yourself with
someone else through food.

321
00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:55.995
Think about it.

322
00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:59.625
We are fed in the Eucharist.

323
00:34:00.835 --> 00:34:04.455
By our mothers
when we are infants.

324
00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:09.715
By our parents
when we are children.

325
00:34:11.755 --> 00:34:13.985
By friends...

326
00:34:14.005 --> 00:34:16.095
at dinner parties.

327
00:34:19.515 --> 00:34:20.785
By a lover...

328
00:34:20.805 --> 00:34:25.855
when we feast on
one another's bodies.

329
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:30.835
And, on occasion...

330
00:34:30.865 --> 00:34:34.275
when we feast on
one another's souls.

331
00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:51.335
Don't you want me to feed you?

332
00:34:57.305 --> 00:34:58.985
You don't want to
feast on my body,

333
00:34:59.015 --> 00:35:02.915
but at least feast on my cake.

334
00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:05.565
- Last chance.
- I...

335
00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:12.485
That wasn't so bad, was it?

336
00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:20.655
May I?

337
00:35:44.265 --> 00:35:47.605
See how nice it is
to be cared for?

338
00:35:49.645 --> 00:35:52.545
See how nice it is...

339
00:35:52.565 --> 00:35:56.445
to be cared for by me?

340
00:35:59.905 --> 00:36:02.115
Spend the night with me.

341
00:36:04.455 --> 00:36:06.645
What about our conversation?

342
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:10.085
We've had enough talking today.

343
00:36:10.545 --> 00:36:11.855
We can talk tomorrow,

344
00:36:11.875 --> 00:36:16.275
when both our heads are clear.

345
00:36:19.345 --> 00:36:22.055
I want you in my bed tonight.

346
00:36:35.405 --> 00:36:38.825
I will be the perfect gentleman.

347
00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:16.875
Goodnight, Julianne.

348
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:31.795
You're leaving?

349
00:37:34.165 --> 00:37:38.525
I said that I wanted you
in my bed and I meant it.

350
00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:40.925
You're safe here.

351
00:39:18.985 --> 00:39:22.115
I tried, but I couldn't
stay away.

352
00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:27.825
I don't want you away from me.

353
00:39:38.005 --> 00:39:41.255
Why did you take
your photos down?

354
00:39:44.925 --> 00:39:47.055
I was ashamed.

355
00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:50.595
You weren't before.

356
00:39:51.845 --> 00:39:56.725
That was before I decided to
bring an angel to my bed.

357
00:40:25.045 --> 00:40:29.115
No... Simon, no.

358
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:32.305
Hey.

359
00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:35.145
Shh.

360
00:41:06.085 --> 00:41:07.565
Good morning, Julianne.

361
00:41:07.585 --> 00:41:09.485
I stepped out for
a brief moment.

362
00:41:09.505 --> 00:41:14.345
Make yourself at home.
XO, Gabriel.

363
00:42:38.675 --> 00:42:40.475
Good morning.

364
00:42:46.525 --> 00:42:48.435
Would you mind?

365
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.425
Did you sleep well?

366
00:42:54.445 --> 00:42:56.675
Once I was beside you, I did.

367
00:42:56.695 --> 00:42:58.405
As did I.

368
00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:10.815
You're shivering.

369
00:43:10.835 --> 00:43:12.985
You make me nervous.

370
00:43:13.005 --> 00:43:14.545
Why?

371
00:43:15.095 --> 00:43:17.325
I never know if
you're gonna be sweet

372
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:20.075
and whisper something
that takes my breath away

373
00:43:20.095 --> 00:43:24.515
or say something so mean
it breaks my heart.

374
00:43:28.145 --> 00:43:30.025
I'm sorry.

375
00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:33.655
There's no excuse for that.

376
00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:39.115
I find you difficult
to talk to sometimes.

377
00:43:39.455 --> 00:43:42.345
- You're only forthcoming when you're furious.
- That isn't true.

378
00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:45.085
Then I need you to talk to me.

379
00:43:46.955 --> 00:43:50.565
Why did you light candles
in your room last night?

380
00:43:50.585 --> 00:43:52.565
I remember what you told me
about the darkness,

381
00:43:52.585 --> 00:43:57.615
and I wanted you to see
Holiday's painting and...

382
00:43:57.635 --> 00:44:00.095
And I was worried you'd run.

383
00:44:03.765 --> 00:44:04.495
Thank you.

384
00:44:04.515 --> 00:44:09.935
I'm a good lover in
all senses of the word.

385
00:44:19.035 --> 00:44:20.905
Are you hungry?

386
00:44:22.455 --> 00:44:24.075
Very.

387
00:44:52.395 --> 00:44:54.895
You're seriously sexy.

388
00:44:55.695 --> 00:44:57.695
Don't make fun of me.

389
00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:01.195
I would never make fun of you.

390
00:45:05.415 --> 00:45:07.375
All right.

391
00:45:25.385 --> 00:45:27.595
You said we'd talk.

392
00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:42.235
What happened the morning after
our night in the orchard?

393
00:45:43.735 --> 00:45:46.595
My memory is a little...

394
00:45:46.615 --> 00:45:48.375
fuzzy.

395
00:45:53.545 --> 00:45:57.485
I woke up before sunrise...

396
00:45:57.505 --> 00:45:59.215
alone.

397
00:46:01.005 --> 00:46:02.595
Gabriel?

398
00:46:09.265 --> 00:46:10.705
Gabriel!

399
00:46:10.725 --> 00:46:13.895
You left me there.

400
00:46:14.065 --> 00:46:17.645
Gabriel!

401
00:46:18.485 --> 00:46:20.575
I was terrified.

402
00:46:30.665 --> 00:46:33.305
That's where you went?

403
00:46:33.335 --> 00:46:35.515
I didn't leave you.

404
00:46:35.545 --> 00:46:37.605
What are you talking about?

405
00:46:37.625 --> 00:46:40.815
I woke up early,
you were sleeping in my arms,

406
00:46:40.835 --> 00:46:44.615
and I didn't want to
wake you up,

407
00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.945
but I needed to...

408
00:46:47.975 --> 00:46:50.055
relieve myself.

409
00:46:51.145 --> 00:46:52.745
But I returned.

410
00:46:52.765 --> 00:46:55.435
With apples for breakfast.

411
00:46:58.315 --> 00:47:00.405
Beatrice.

412
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:03.275
You were gone.

413
00:47:05.905 --> 00:47:10.365
I came back to my room and I...

414
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:11.845
And I fell asleep.

415
00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:14.725
Why didn't you try to find me?

416
00:47:14.745 --> 00:47:17.435
When I woke up I asked
where Beatrice was.

417
00:47:17.455 --> 00:47:20.855
Richard told me
I was delusional.

418
00:47:20.875 --> 00:47:25.405
No one mentioned you
or your name, I...

419
00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:27.735
I thought it was a dream.

420
00:47:27.765 --> 00:47:30.765
How could you think that?

421
00:47:31.555 --> 00:47:36.165
I was hungover and
I was confused.

422
00:47:36.185 --> 00:47:38.735
And I was strung out on coke.

423
00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:44.985
Rachel didn't tell you?

424
00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:47.465
Richard knew I was on something

425
00:47:47.495 --> 00:47:50.365
when he picked me up
the night before.

426
00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:55.685
He searched my room,
found my stash,

427
00:47:55.705 --> 00:47:59.145
and when he confronted me,
I... I snapped.

428
00:47:59.165 --> 00:48:01.755
The fight with Scott.

429
00:48:02.005 --> 00:48:05.065
I spent the most
romantic night of my life

430
00:48:05.095 --> 00:48:07.485
with a guy strung out on coke.

431
00:48:07.515 --> 00:48:11.445
What a stupid, stupid girl.

432
00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:13.405
You're not stupid.

433
00:48:13.435 --> 00:48:14.705
I'm the fuck up.

434
00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.375
I was planning on
killing myself that night,

435
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:20.205
and you changed that.

436
00:48:20.235 --> 00:48:21.835
I thought you were an angel.

437
00:48:21.855 --> 00:48:24.545
And that God, perhaps,
had shown mercy to me

438
00:48:24.565 --> 00:48:26.735
and sent you to save me.

439
00:48:27.535 --> 00:48:31.615
Why did you want to
kill yourself?

440
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:39.335
I can't tell you that.

441
00:48:40.955 --> 00:48:42.145
I don't know what would happen

442
00:48:42.165 --> 00:48:45.045
if I brought those
old demons back.

443
00:48:49.755 --> 00:48:52.865
Are you still suicidal?

444
00:48:52.885 --> 00:48:54.435
No.

445
00:48:55.305 --> 00:49:00.745
Part of my depression was
caused by the drugs, and...

446
00:49:00.775 --> 00:49:02.625
part of it was caused by
other factors

447
00:49:02.645 --> 00:49:06.195
that I was trying to
deal with in my life.

448
00:49:12.615 --> 00:49:13.755
"Lo seme di felicita

449
00:49:13.785 --> 00:49:17.205
messo de Dio nell'anima
ben posta."

450
00:49:17.285 --> 00:49:21.625
Quoting Dante can't change
what happened.

451
00:49:23.715 --> 00:49:27.315
I won't get involved with
a drug addict.

452
00:49:27.335 --> 00:49:28.855
I've been clean for six years.

453
00:49:28.885 --> 00:49:32.865
I won't get involved with
an alcoholic either.

454
00:49:32.885 --> 00:49:34.275
My mom was one.

455
00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:35.995
I admit I drink,

456
00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:38.645
but I'm not addicted to alcohol.

457
00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:42.035
I'm not that same naive
17-year-old girl.

458
00:49:42.065 --> 00:49:43.995
No, you're a beautiful woman,
Beatrice.

459
00:49:44.025 --> 00:49:47.795
Stop saying that.
It's an illusion!

460
00:49:47.815 --> 00:49:50.795
It was real.
It was everything.

461
00:49:50.825 --> 00:49:53.135
As soon as I touched you,
I knew.

462
00:49:53.155 --> 00:49:56.495
I remembered you.
My body remembers you.

463
00:49:57.785 --> 00:50:02.395
It was only my conscious mind
that had forgotten.

464
00:50:02.415 --> 00:50:05.015
I know I have hurt you.

465
00:50:05.045 --> 00:50:08.255
And I know I have a dark side.

466
00:50:09.595 --> 00:50:13.115
Will you let me show
what I can do?

467
00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:17.765
Will you let me show
that I can be good?

468
00:50:18.435 --> 00:50:21.475
I can be very, very good.

469
00:50:24.895 --> 00:50:27.735
This isn't how I imagined it.

470
00:50:28.315 --> 00:50:30.545
Finding you again
is so different

471
00:50:30.565 --> 00:50:32.865
from how I dreamed.

472
00:50:34.115 --> 00:50:36.635
You aren't who
I thought you were.

473
00:50:36.655 --> 00:50:40.435
You came to me last night,
and it was all there.

474
00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:43.835
Every feeling, every...

475
00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:48.645
Every memory,

476
00:50:48.675 --> 00:50:52.045
every sensation I had came back.

477
00:50:52.385 --> 00:50:56.595
Tell me it meant nothing to you
and I'll let you go.

478
00:50:59.975 --> 00:51:03.665
Your skin remembers me,

479
00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:05.855
and so does your heart.

480
00:51:31.125 --> 00:51:32.275
Remember your first.

481
00:51:40.095 --> 00:51:43.155
Let me show you what I can do

482
00:51:43.185 --> 00:51:45.225
when I take it slow.

483
00:52:27.685 --> 00:52:31.485
Last night, you talked about
being friends.

484
00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:35.655
Friends don't kiss like that.

485
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:38.405
I want to court you.

486
00:52:40.575 --> 00:52:44.155
And I intend to kiss you a lot.

487
00:52:49.915 --> 00:52:51.935
I won't be shared.

488
00:52:51.965 --> 00:52:56.215
I'm not in the habit of sharing
what's precious to me.

489
00:52:57.755 --> 00:53:00.135
I won't share you either.

490
00:53:03.805 --> 00:53:06.825
You may not sleep with
anyone else,

491
00:53:06.855 --> 00:53:10.455
even while I'm still...
deciding.

492
00:53:10.475 --> 00:53:12.035
Done.

493
00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:14.065
What about Paulina?

494
00:53:16.065 --> 00:53:17.125
Don't worry about her.

495
00:53:17.155 --> 00:53:19.505
Is she your wife?
Ex-wife?

496
00:53:19.525 --> 00:53:20.755
No.

497
00:53:20.785 --> 00:53:23.805
What about M-A-I-A,
the tattoo on your chest?

498
00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:26.265
Please stop.
I can't.

499
00:53:26.285 --> 00:53:27.305
Then neither can I.

500
00:53:27.325 --> 00:53:31.515
Tell me who made you feel
so insecure about yourself?

501
00:53:31.545 --> 00:53:34.755
Hm? Was it Simon?

502
00:53:35.335 --> 00:53:39.095
You said it in your sleep
and you sounded upset.

503
00:53:41.095 --> 00:53:42.485
- Tell me.
- No.

504
00:53:42.515 --> 00:53:44.095
Why not?

505
00:53:44.475 --> 00:53:47.475
Because it makes me sick.

506
00:53:49.095 --> 00:53:53.495
He... He didn't force you,
did he?

507
00:53:53.525 --> 00:53:55.025
No.

508
00:53:59.615 --> 00:54:03.235
We both have secrets
we don't want to tell.

509
00:54:05.995 --> 00:54:08.055
I won't lie to you,

510
00:54:08.075 --> 00:54:11.095
but I can't tell you everything.

511
00:54:11.125 --> 00:54:13.915
I know I've disappointed you.

512
00:54:14.715 --> 00:54:18.625
I wish I was the knight
rather than the dragon.

513
00:54:21.345 --> 00:54:24.195
You can banish me,

514
00:54:24.215 --> 00:54:27.265
or save me with a single word.

515
00:54:47.705 --> 00:54:49.745
I should go.

516
00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:58.465
I need to prepare for my
meeting with Professor Picton.

517
00:54:58.835 --> 00:55:01.255
When will I see you again?

518
00:55:02.045 --> 00:55:03.905
At your seminar next week.

519
00:55:03.925 --> 00:55:06.255
That's too far off.

520
00:55:07.215 --> 00:55:09.535
- Dinner?
- I can't.

521
00:55:09.555 --> 00:55:14.435
You're still my professor
and I'm your student.

522
00:55:34.335 --> 00:55:38.935
"The Figure of Beatrice: A Study
in Dante" by Charles Williams?

523
00:55:38.965 --> 00:55:42.965
Katherine will be impressed
if you're familiar with it.

524
00:55:43.275 --> 00:55:45.845
Thank you.

525
00:55:55.765 --> 00:55:57.815
Goodbye, Gabriel.

526
00:56:30.845 --> 00:56:31.865
It's Gabriel Emerson.

527
00:56:31.885 --> 00:56:34.935
I need to speak to John
immediately.

528
00:56:35.935 --> 00:56:38.835
Tell him I'm on my way
to see him.

529
00:56:38.855 --> 00:56:40.525
Thanks.

530
00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:56.435
Julia Mitchell, I presume.

531
00:56:56.455 --> 00:57:00.145
Yes. It's wonderful to meet
you, Professor Picton.

532
00:57:00.165 --> 00:57:02.545
Please, sit.

533
00:57:04.085 --> 00:57:08.105
Your grades from St. Joseph's
are impressive.

534
00:57:08.135 --> 00:57:09.405
Thank you.

535
00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.075
But if I'm to be your advisor,

536
00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:14.555
I'll need more than good grades.

537
00:57:18.555 --> 00:57:22.775
I fell in love with Dante
when I was 17.

538
00:57:22.855 --> 00:57:27.005
Ever since then,
he's haunted my dreams.

539
00:57:27.025 --> 00:57:28.775
Continue.

540
00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:32.675
My professional advice is to
stay away from her.

541
00:57:32.695 --> 00:57:33.675
Impossible.

542
00:57:33.695 --> 00:57:35.345
- Is she at least over 18?
- What?

543
00:57:35.365 --> 00:57:36.935
Please tell me you're not
screwing a freshman.

544
00:57:36.955 --> 00:57:40.095
Don't be vile, John.
She's a grad student.

545
00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:41.305
Oh, good.

546
00:57:41.335 --> 00:57:42.265
I can't state for sure

547
00:57:42.295 --> 00:57:44.515
without first seeing the
non-fraternization policy,

548
00:57:44.545 --> 00:57:46.315
but you're likely putting
your job in jeopardy

549
00:57:46.335 --> 00:57:47.605
if you're sleeping with
a student.

550
00:57:47.635 --> 00:57:50.985
- We're not sleeping together.
- Keep it that way.

551
00:57:51.005 --> 00:57:52.195
No sexual activity whatsoever,

552
00:57:52.215 --> 00:57:54.575
and it doesn't matter
if it's consensual.

553
00:57:54.595 --> 00:57:56.185
Got it?

554
00:57:57.435 --> 00:58:01.535
But what if we're involved
romantically and not sexually?

555
00:58:03.275 --> 00:58:05.255
Are you kidding me, Emerson?

556
00:58:05.275 --> 00:58:06.215
I'm dead serious.

557
00:58:06.235 --> 00:58:09.675
Would our platonic relationship
violate that policy or not?

558
00:58:09.695 --> 00:58:10.635
Given your reputation?

559
00:58:10.655 --> 00:58:15.255
Regardless
if you're believed or not,

560
00:58:15.285 --> 00:58:16.715
the employer would
still have to provide

561
00:58:16.745 --> 00:58:20.055
evidence of a sexual nature,
unless your chiquita...

562
00:58:20.075 --> 00:58:22.345
Don't call her that.

563
00:58:22.375 --> 00:58:26.895
Unless she or someone else
files a complaint against you.

564
00:58:26.915 --> 00:58:28.185
And if they can't prove it?

565
00:58:28.215 --> 00:58:29.565
If they can't prove
you were fucking,

566
00:58:29.585 --> 00:58:31.605
you'd likely receive a reprimand
for an improper relationship,

567
00:58:31.635 --> 00:58:35.775
but I can't state for certain
without first seeing the policy.

568
00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:44.125
- Thank you, John.
- And, Gabriel,

569
00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:45.125
stay out of trouble.

570
00:58:45.145 --> 00:58:49.255
No girls, no fist fights,
no public drunkenness, nothing.

571
00:58:49.275 --> 00:58:52.585
Any lawsuit with the university
will expose your past.

572
00:58:52.615 --> 00:58:54.775
Remember that.

573
00:59:05.335 --> 00:59:07.505
Julianne, it's Gabriel.

574
00:59:15.505 --> 00:59:17.695
What are you doing here?

575
00:59:17.715 --> 00:59:19.595
Dinner.

576
00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:27.525
Nice towel.

577
00:59:28.685 --> 00:59:30.355
I'll change.

578
00:59:46.495 --> 00:59:48.585
What's all this for?

579
00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:51.775
Just a little something to
celebrate Katherine

580
00:59:51.795 --> 00:59:54.835
agreeing to be your advisor.

581
00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:56.065
How do you know she agreed?

582
00:59:56.095 --> 01:00:00.535
She told me. She also told me
that you impressed her greatly.

583
01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:04.285
I didn't think I would when she
said my subject was derivative.

584
01:00:04.305 --> 01:00:07.165
Instead of comparing
courtly love and lust,

585
01:00:07.185 --> 01:00:09.245
I'm going to examine
aspects of friendship

586
01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:13.045
between Virgil and Dante with
the theme of courtly love.

587
01:00:13.065 --> 01:00:17.295
So instead of lust and love,
it'll be...

588
01:00:17.325 --> 01:00:19.155
love and friendship.

589
01:00:21.245 --> 01:00:23.135
Sounds appropriate.

590
01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:27.015
What about the
non-fraternization policy?

591
01:00:27.035 --> 01:00:30.015
As long as we're
chaste and discreet,

592
01:00:30.045 --> 01:00:33.425
I don't think
we'll have a problem.

593
01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:41.015
Does that mean no kissing?

594
01:00:43.185 --> 01:00:44.495
Do you want me to kiss you?

595
01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:50.035
You can't be kissing me one moment
and grading my essays the next.

596
01:00:50.065 --> 01:00:54.715
True. I'll ask Katherine
to grade your work.

597
01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:59.025
Now, where were we?

598
01:01:00.195 --> 01:01:03.845
Is this just an affair to you?

599
01:01:03.865 --> 01:01:04.885
No.

600
01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:09.335
No, I... I want us to
get to know each other.

601
01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:14.425
I want to spend as much time
with you as possible.

602
01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.025
And once the semester is over,

603
01:01:16.045 --> 01:01:19.355
we can see where this
is going, but...

604
01:01:19.385 --> 01:01:21.635
that's entirely up to you.

605
01:01:26.055 --> 01:01:28.185
I'm at your mercy.

606
01:01:58.925 --> 01:02:01.615
This is a declaration of desire.

607
01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.485
If we were lovers,
I would have kissed you like that

608
01:02:04.515 --> 01:02:08.535
just to signal my intention
to take you to bed.

609
01:02:08.555 --> 01:02:11.825
But for now, I can only declare

610
01:02:11.855 --> 01:02:14.645
that I burn for you.

611
01:02:17.695 --> 01:02:22.615
Let's eat.
I promise not to stay late.

612
01:02:26.035 --> 01:02:28.375
I don't want you to go.

613
01:02:38.585 --> 01:02:40.545
What was that?

614
01:02:43.005 --> 01:02:46.015
I want you to stay with me.

615
01:03:15.665 --> 01:03:17.455
Good morning.

616
01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.025
You're not saying much.

617
01:03:23.045 --> 01:03:24.105
You're half naked.

618
01:03:24.135 --> 01:03:28.025
You want me to be wholly naked?

619
01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:29.725
I'm kidding.

620
01:04:10.135 --> 01:04:11.695
By that, Dante means...

621
01:05:05.065 --> 01:05:06.005
They're beautiful.

622
01:07:14.695 --> 01:07:17.175
Are you going home for
Thanksgiving?

623
01:07:17.195 --> 01:07:19.095
Yes. Are you?

624
01:07:19.115 --> 01:07:20.745
Yes.

625
01:07:21.325 --> 01:07:25.245
Would you consider
flying with me?

626
01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.005
I'd like that.

627
01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:37.275
I don't like Thanksgiving,

628
01:07:37.305 --> 01:07:39.615
but Grace made it nice.

629
01:07:39.635 --> 01:07:42.615
We didn't really celebrate.

630
01:07:42.645 --> 01:07:44.475
Why not?

631
01:07:46.275 --> 01:07:49.995
During my last Thanksgiving
with my mom,

632
01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:53.945
she was on a bender with
one of her boyfriends.

633
01:07:54.365 --> 01:07:57.335
I decided to cook
a Martha Stewart recipe.

634
01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:01.305
I put all the food on a tray
to carry it to the table.

635
01:08:01.325 --> 01:08:05.185
And her boyfriend stuck out
his foot and tripped me.

636
01:08:05.205 --> 01:08:08.165
Everything went flying.

637
01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.315
Were you hurt?

638
01:08:10.335 --> 01:08:12.215
I don't remember.

639
01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:16.155
Sharon just laughed at me.

640
01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:20.985
And then got bored and
went into her room to...

641
01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:24.855
They didn't even bother
closing the door.

642
01:08:27.055 --> 01:08:28.645
My God.

643
01:08:48.955 --> 01:08:51.255
What's this scar from?

644
01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:55.135
You can tell me.

645
01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.515
Sharon hit me.

646
01:09:07.055 --> 01:09:12.815
I fell and hit my head against
the corner of the kitchen counter.

647
01:09:15.025 --> 01:09:19.135
I called my dad in the
hospital and said...

648
01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:23.385
that if head he didn't come
and pick me up,

649
01:09:23.405 --> 01:09:25.455
I was gonna run away.

650
01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.625
And that was it.

651
01:09:33.965 --> 01:09:36.675
I never saw my mom again.

652
01:09:40.255 --> 01:09:43.885
I'm sorry that those things
happened to you.

653
01:09:46.595 --> 01:09:49.105
I was pretty lucky, actually.

654
01:09:50.515 --> 01:09:53.085
Sharon only hit me once.

655
01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:55.275
No one hits me here.

656
01:09:57.525 --> 01:10:01.275
And I have a friend
who feeds me.

657
01:10:03.655 --> 01:10:08.425
You should have been
cuddled and adored,

658
01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:11.085
and treated like a princess.

659
01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:13.815
I don't believe in fairy tales.

660
01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:16.275
I'd like to make you believe.

661
01:10:34.185 --> 01:10:36.355
Do you have any scars?

662
01:10:37.235 --> 01:10:42.375
You can't hit something that
you don't know is there.

663
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.115
I'm sorry.

664
01:10:44.325 --> 01:10:47.595
It's difficult to know
what's worse,

665
01:10:47.615 --> 01:10:51.205
being hit or being ignored.

666
01:10:51.335 --> 01:10:54.955
I guess it depends on
the kind of pain you prefer.

667
01:10:56.715 --> 01:11:01.595
Happiness is something I know
precious little about.

668
01:11:05.385 --> 01:11:08.095
Why aren't you happy now?

669
01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:13.225
"I bartered my birthright
for a bowl of pottage."

670
01:11:18.695 --> 01:11:21.335
Yes, I can quote scripture.

671
01:11:21.355 --> 01:11:23.115
I'm not a pagan.

672
01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:27.785
Richard and Grace
were devout Episcopalians.

673
01:11:29.205 --> 01:11:32.455
I only go to Mass when I'm sad.

674
01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:35.705
Or at Easter or Christmas.

675
01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:42.275
I still believe even though
I don't live like it.

676
01:11:42.295 --> 01:11:44.905
I know that makes me
a hypocrite.

677
01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:46.655
All believers are hypocrites

678
01:11:46.675 --> 01:11:50.155
because none of us
live up to our beliefs.

679
01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:53.765
But if you still believe,
you have hope.

680
01:11:54.555 --> 01:11:58.355
Happiness is possible
for you, too.

681
01:12:03.115 --> 01:12:05.405
I lost my soul.

682
01:12:07.995 --> 01:12:10.115
What do you mean?

683
01:12:12.325 --> 01:12:15.995
I have committed
the sin unto death.

684
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:32.135
Do you believe there's a
difference between right and wrong?

685
01:12:32.635 --> 01:12:34.535
Of course.

686
01:12:34.555 --> 01:12:37.835
But knowing isn't the problem.

687
01:12:37.855 --> 01:12:40.415
It's the doing.

688
01:12:40.435 --> 01:12:42.125
Only a creature with a soul

689
01:12:42.155 --> 01:12:45.835
can tell the difference
between right and wrong.

690
01:12:45.865 --> 01:12:50.865
You've made mistakes,
but you feel remorse.

691
01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:55.675
You still have your soul.

692
01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:59.245
A chance at redemption.

693
01:13:11.515 --> 01:13:13.385
Will you stay?

694
01:13:16.095 --> 01:13:19.495
I won't let anyone hurt you.

695
01:13:19.515 --> 01:13:21.685
Least of all me.

696
01:13:34.575 --> 01:13:37.095
When is your birthday?

697
01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:39.895
Ah, come on.
Don't deprive me.

698
01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.975
When is your birthday?

699
01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:43.605
September 1st.
You missed it.

700
01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:44.975
No, I haven't.

701
01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:48.155
Are you free next Saturday?

702
01:13:48.185 --> 01:13:51.015
We can celebrate it then.

703
01:13:51.515 --> 01:13:52.485
What will we be doing?

704
01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:53.775
Let me worry about that.

705
01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:57.895
Are you accepting
my invitation or not?

706
01:13:58.805 --> 01:14:01.415
I am accept with gratitude.

707
01:14:01.435 --> 01:14:03.585
Please don't tickle me.

708
01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:07.395
Please don't tickle me.

709
01:14:11.275 --> 01:14:13.885
I want to see you Friday night.

710
01:14:13.905 --> 01:14:16.265
- After your lecture?
- Mm-hm.

711
01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:19.185
I'll have to come up with
an excuse for Paul.

712
01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.335
We're going together.

713
01:14:22.995 --> 01:14:27.105
Did we or did we not have
an arrangement

714
01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:29.505
that excluded sharing?

715
01:14:30.545 --> 01:14:32.355
We're friends.

716
01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.575
He asked me to go.
I didn't think it was wrong.

717
01:14:35.595 --> 01:14:39.745
Do you want me seeing
other women as friends?

718
01:14:39.765 --> 01:14:43.035
Going to public events
with them?

719
01:14:43.065 --> 01:14:43.705
No.

720
01:14:43.725 --> 01:14:46.735
Then extend me
the same courtesy.

721
01:14:51.655 --> 01:14:55.715
Being a grad student
in a strange city is lonely.

722
01:14:55.735 --> 01:15:00.425
Please don't make me give up
the one friend I have,

723
01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:01.515
apart from you.

724
01:15:01.535 --> 01:15:02.895
Then I really will be isolated

725
01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.895
since I can't be around you
all the time.

726
01:15:06.915 --> 01:15:10.675
Julianne, I'll concede that
you need a friend.

727
01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:16.135
But he needs to realize that
you are no longer available.

728
01:15:17.175 --> 01:15:19.155
He's far too invested as it is,

729
01:15:19.185 --> 01:15:24.225
and that could create
a problem for us.

730
01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:29.395
I'll tell him
I have a boyfriend.

731
01:15:31.405 --> 01:15:33.695
And his name is Owen.

732
01:15:57.715 --> 01:16:00.115
Look at him.

733
01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:02.325
A vest and a pocket watch?

734
01:16:02.355 --> 01:16:04.745
How old is this guy?

735
01:16:04.765 --> 01:16:06.665
I bet he has a personal
portrait in his attic

736
01:16:06.685 --> 01:16:09.835
that's aging rather rapidly.

737
01:16:09.855 --> 01:16:10.875
Professor.

738
01:16:10.895 --> 01:16:11.875
Looking forward to this.

739
01:16:11.895 --> 01:16:16.115
Who's that next to
Professor Martin?

740
01:16:16.195 --> 01:16:17.885
Professor Singer.

741
01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:20.305
- Professor.
- She's the worst.

742
01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:22.845
She's known as Professor Pain.

743
01:16:22.865 --> 01:16:24.435
Pain?

744
01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:26.375
She's into S&M.

745
01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:29.835
You should check out her website.
It's pretty hard-core.

746
01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:34.735
Better yet, don't.

747
01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:38.255
Stay away from her.
I do.

748
01:16:42.975 --> 01:16:45.655
I feel so overdressed.

749
01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.475
You look nice.

750
01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.105
Your boyfriend's a lucky guy.

751
01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.755
Professor Martin invited me to
the faculty dinner after,

752
01:17:00.785 --> 01:17:03.995
and he said I could
bring a guest.

753
01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:07.345
Want to go?

754
01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:09.165
As friends?

755
01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:12.415
Welcome.

756
01:17:14.875 --> 01:17:17.605
"Lust in Dante's Inferno:

757
01:17:17.635 --> 01:17:22.435
The Deadly Sin
Against the Self."

758
01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:26.205
Immediately,
one might wonder why lust

759
01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.785
would be a sin against the self

760
01:17:29.815 --> 01:17:33.835
since it is always directed
toward another,

761
01:17:33.855 --> 01:17:36.545
the use of another human being

762
01:17:36.565 --> 01:17:40.825
for personal, sexual
gratification.

763
01:17:41.995 --> 01:17:45.765
Evil can only feed off of
goodness

764
01:17:45.785 --> 01:17:46.675
like a parasite.

765
01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:49.725
If all the goodness of
a creature were eliminated,

766
01:17:49.745 --> 01:17:52.015
then the creature in question
would no longer exist.

767
01:17:52.045 --> 01:17:55.145
In making the connection
between Beatrice and Virgil,

768
01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:59.855
Dante is expressing his notion
that...

769
01:17:59.885 --> 01:18:01.945
courtly love...

770
01:18:01.965 --> 01:18:06.895
is tied to reason
rather than passion.

771
01:18:08.395 --> 01:18:10.515
But what of lust?

772
01:18:12.185 --> 01:18:16.415
If love is the rabbit,

773
01:18:16.445 --> 01:18:19.275
then lust is the wolf.

774
01:18:22.445 --> 01:18:24.005
Dante says so explicitly

775
01:18:24.035 --> 01:18:27.305
when he identifies lust
as a sin,

776
01:18:27.325 --> 01:18:31.585
a sin in which passion
overtakes reason.

777
01:18:32.085 --> 01:18:36.355
In Dante's philosophy,
lust is a misplaced love,

778
01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:40.155
but a kind of love nonetheless.

779
01:18:40.185 --> 01:18:40.985
For this reason,

780
01:18:41.005 --> 01:18:46.305
it is the least evil of
the seven deadly sins.

781
01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:53.955
In contrast to lust,
which is a mortal sin...

782
01:18:53.975 --> 01:18:55.605
is love.

783
01:18:56.815 --> 01:19:01.255
Dante argues that a lover is
related to his beloved

784
01:19:01.275 --> 01:19:04.695
as if...

785
01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:08.885
his beloved...

786
01:19:08.915 --> 01:19:11.625
were a part of himself.

787
01:19:24.465 --> 01:19:26.095
Emerson.

788
01:19:27.265 --> 01:19:29.765
Come sit.

789
01:19:29.935 --> 01:19:33.515
I've ordered Sangria
for everyone.

790
01:19:45.695 --> 01:19:49.555
Looks like Emerson and Singer
are at it again?

791
01:19:49.575 --> 01:19:51.175
What?

792
01:19:51.205 --> 01:19:52.175
They had an affair.

793
01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:56.645
And from the looks of it,
it never ended.

794
01:19:56.665 --> 01:19:58.975
They dated?

795
01:19:59.005 --> 01:20:00.435
Singer doesn't date.

796
01:20:00.465 --> 01:20:04.095
She's into pain and control.

797
01:20:09.055 --> 01:20:12.365
That means he's into...

798
01:20:12.395 --> 01:20:15.395
S&M. Yeah.

799
01:20:37.335 --> 01:20:41.465
Excuse me. I need to use
the ladies room.

800
01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:56.365
Please don't come to dinner.

801
01:20:56.395 --> 01:20:57.285
Go to my place.

802
01:20:57.315 --> 01:20:59.955
The concierge will let you in.

803
01:20:59.975 --> 01:21:01.795
I'll explain later.

804
01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:04.445
Do as I ask. G.

805
01:21:04.525 --> 01:21:06.255
My phone was off.

806
01:21:33.595 --> 01:21:35.955
I'm Professor Singer.

807
01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:38.705
It's a pleasure to meet you.

808
01:21:38.725 --> 01:21:40.355
Julia.

809
01:21:44.565 --> 01:21:47.255
Do I make you nervous, Julia?

810
01:21:47.275 --> 01:21:50.735
No. If you'll excuse me.

811
01:21:51.405 --> 01:21:54.595
Did you like watching
what I was doing to Emerson

812
01:21:54.615 --> 01:21:56.095
under the table?

813
01:21:56.115 --> 01:21:58.885
Because I saw you looking.

814
01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:02.835
- I...
- I think I've made you blush.

815
01:22:02.915 --> 01:22:08.505
In fact, I think I've made
you blush all over your body.

816
01:22:08.635 --> 01:22:12.135
I think you want me
to tease you.

817
01:22:12.635 --> 01:22:15.615
You'd make a very pretty pet.

818
01:22:15.635 --> 01:22:19.285
I'm not interested in being
anyone's pet.

819
01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:23.335
Feisty. Ooh!
I like a feisty pet.

820
01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:26.415
I'm a human being,
not a fucking animal.

821
01:22:27.195 --> 01:22:29.505
Human beings are animals,
my dear.

822
01:22:29.525 --> 01:22:34.845
We share the same physiology,
the same reactions to stimuli,

823
01:22:34.865 --> 01:22:39.385
and we have the same need
for food, drink,

824
01:22:39.415 --> 01:22:42.145
and... sex.

825
01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:43.805
I know what an animal is,

826
01:22:43.835 --> 01:22:48.255
and I have no interest
in being fucked like one.

827
01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:51.065
If you change your mind,

828
01:22:51.095 --> 01:22:52.025
come and find us.

829
01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:55.475
Us? Not a chance in hell!

830
01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.495
- Shh.
- Let go of me!

831
01:23:00.515 --> 01:23:01.575
It's me.

832
01:23:01.605 --> 01:23:04.875
I saw Singer follow you.
What did she do to you?

833
01:23:04.895 --> 01:23:07.415
She invited me to become
her pet.

834
01:23:07.445 --> 01:23:09.415
This is what I wanted to avoid.

835
01:23:09.445 --> 01:23:11.715
You're like a lamb to her wolf.

836
01:23:11.735 --> 01:23:12.635
She only noticed me

837
01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:15.425
because I caught her
molesting you under the table.

838
01:23:15.445 --> 01:23:16.635
She's goading me.

839
01:23:16.655 --> 01:23:20.095
It's... It's a game for her.
I can't react.

840
01:23:20.115 --> 01:23:22.095
Well, I can and it's disgusting.

841
01:23:22.125 --> 01:23:24.935
Please. You're shaking.
Tell me if she hurt you.

842
01:23:24.955 --> 01:23:27.605
Hurt me? No.
I handled it.

843
01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:31.235
But tell me,
did you let her hurt you?

844
01:23:31.255 --> 01:23:32.355
What did Paul tell you?

845
01:23:32.385 --> 01:23:36.235
Enough. Are you into
that sort of thing?

846
01:23:36.255 --> 01:23:38.495
This is not the place
to discuss it.

847
01:23:38.515 --> 01:23:40.195
Do you still want her?

848
01:23:40.225 --> 01:23:45.075
No. No! Never. It was just
a couple of encounters.

849
01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:46.795
It was over a year ago.

850
01:23:46.815 --> 01:23:48.755
Is she one of the women
in your photos?

851
01:23:48.775 --> 01:23:50.875
Fuck, no! Those were
women I liked.

852
01:23:50.895 --> 01:23:55.335
Julianne,
I can't explain this here.

853
01:23:55.365 --> 01:23:57.035
Please.

854
01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:03.785
I don't understand why anyone
would not choose kindness.

855
01:24:05.205 --> 01:24:08.505
Life is painful enough.

856
01:24:15.505 --> 01:24:17.405
Go to my place.

857
01:24:17.425 --> 01:24:20.495
I'll meet you there later.

858
01:24:20.515 --> 01:24:22.185
Please.

859
01:24:22.765 --> 01:24:27.225
I feel like I have no idea
who you really are.

860
01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:30.605
And that hurts.

861
01:24:39.285 --> 01:24:41.305
Not feeling well. Sorry.

862
01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:43.615
I'm going home.

863
01:26:56.335 --> 01:26:58.395
You're still here.

864
01:26:58.425 --> 01:27:00.855
I was worried you wouldn't...

865
01:27:00.885 --> 01:27:02.805
So was I.

866
01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:26.195
You looked so beautiful tonight.

867
01:27:29.325 --> 01:27:32.435
Sorry, I had my boots
on your sofa.

868
01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:33.805
I'll take them off.

869
01:27:33.835 --> 01:27:37.335
Please. Let me.

870
01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:41.885
I've been admiring them
all night.

871
01:28:32.685 --> 01:28:34.815
Ohh...

872
01:28:42.655 --> 01:28:46.425
It's okay to voice
your pleasure.

873
01:28:46.445 --> 01:28:50.575
It reassures me that
I don't repulse you.

874
01:28:50.655 --> 01:28:53.665
You don't repulse me.

875
01:28:53.785 --> 01:28:56.375
I'm glad to hear that.

876
01:29:13.765 --> 01:29:17.995
Are you into...

877
01:29:18.015 --> 01:29:21.895
the kind of pain
Singer provides?

878
01:29:22.195 --> 01:29:23.775
No.

879
01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:27.135
But you were with her
and you let her hurt you.

880
01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:30.155
She didn't hurt me.

881
01:29:30.735 --> 01:29:34.515
She left no scars, only regrets.

882
01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:37.375
Not all scars are physical.

883
01:29:45.925 --> 01:29:49.465
I can't be with someone
who hits.

884
01:29:53.975 --> 01:29:58.745
It is not in my nature
to be violent with women,

885
01:29:58.765 --> 01:30:02.525
but rather to be seductive.

886
01:30:03.235 --> 01:30:05.645
Ann was an exception.

887
01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:10.735
Why her?
Why that exception?

888
01:30:13.445 --> 01:30:16.115
I was in a dark place.

889
01:30:16.915 --> 01:30:21.305
I thought she could
help me and...

890
01:30:21.335 --> 01:30:23.085
And I was wrong.

891
01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:26.965
And I figured that out quickly.

892
01:30:27.085 --> 01:30:30.425
What if the darkness comes back?

893
01:30:30.885 --> 01:30:34.175
You dispel the darkness,
Beatrice.

894
01:30:36.385 --> 01:30:38.185
Julianne.

895
01:30:44.855 --> 01:30:48.695
I can't bear the thought of
someone hitting you.

896
01:30:49.065 --> 01:30:52.655
Promise me you'll never
go back to her.

897
01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:56.405
I'll never ask for
anything but that.

898
01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:04.585
Nobody has shown me
such kindness.

899
01:31:08.045 --> 01:31:10.215
Your family has.

900
01:31:11.715 --> 01:31:14.345
Just open your eyes.

901
01:31:16.095 --> 01:31:20.935
My beautiful innocent angel.

902
01:31:29.195 --> 01:31:31.735
I'm not that innocent.

903
01:31:35.485 --> 01:31:38.845
I'm a virgin,
but you can't have this idea

904
01:31:38.865 --> 01:31:42.245
that I've never
done things before.

905
01:31:43.995 --> 01:31:45.645
I mean...

906
01:31:45.665 --> 01:31:51.045
I had a boyfriend
and we dated for years.

907
01:31:51.875 --> 01:31:53.505
Simon?

908
01:31:55.095 --> 01:31:56.695
And we did things.

909
01:31:56.715 --> 01:31:58.805
What kind of things?

910
01:32:01.345 --> 01:32:03.955
I don't want to know.

911
01:32:09.435 --> 01:32:11.395
Did he hurt you?

912
01:32:15.695 --> 01:32:22.665
He was impatient
and manipulative.

913
01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:27.875
He told me I was frigid.

914
01:32:29.665 --> 01:32:31.415
Bastard.

915
01:32:34.505 --> 01:32:37.305
It wasn't all his fault.

916
01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:43.805
Did you love him?

917
01:32:46.315 --> 01:32:47.815
No.

918
01:32:52.735 --> 01:32:54.315
Kiss me.

919
01:32:54.905 --> 01:32:58.045
I want to kiss you all the time,

920
01:32:58.075 --> 01:33:02.715
but I don't want to
make you feel pressured,

921
01:33:02.745 --> 01:33:06.575
so sometimes you'll need
to take the lead.

922
01:33:43.905 --> 01:33:45.975
We have to stop.

923
01:33:45.995 --> 01:33:47.475
I'm sorry.

924
01:33:47.495 --> 01:33:51.955
Never apologize
for your desires.

925
01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:59.095
You're beautiful and sensual.

926
01:34:02.135 --> 01:34:04.675
But we have to stop.

927
01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:25.135
Happy Birthday, Darling.

928
01:34:25.155 --> 01:34:27.805
Please do me the honor of
gracing me with your presence

929
01:34:27.825 --> 01:34:32.475
at the Royal Ontario Museum
this Saturday evening at 6:00.

930
01:34:32.495 --> 01:34:38.505
Yours with affection and
deepest longing, Gabriel.

931
01:34:48.145 --> 01:34:49.325
Good evening, Miss Mitchell.

932
01:34:49.355 --> 01:34:52.285
Your host is
waiting for you upstairs.

933
01:34:52.315 --> 01:34:54.125
And I'll take your coat.

934
01:34:54.145 --> 01:34:56.315
Thank you.

935
01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:24.005
Hello, handsome.

936
01:35:33.105 --> 01:35:35.355
You look stunning.

937
01:35:40.905 --> 01:35:45.285
Gabriel, we're in public.

938
01:35:55.795 --> 01:35:58.045
A corsage?

939
01:35:59.125 --> 01:36:01.125
I missed your prom.

940
01:36:41.755 --> 01:36:43.855
How did you arrange all this?

941
01:36:43.885 --> 01:36:47.735
I donated a large sum to the
Florentine exhibit last spring,

942
01:36:47.755 --> 01:36:50.975
so I called in a favor.

943
01:36:53.645 --> 01:36:55.705
A flirtini, please.

944
01:36:55.725 --> 01:36:58.625
Tonic water with
a twist of lime.

945
01:36:58.645 --> 01:37:01.855
I have wine at home for us.

946
01:37:12.455 --> 01:37:15.495
It's so quiet in here.

947
01:37:21.205 --> 01:37:23.545
You are a vision.

948
01:37:24.295 --> 01:37:26.065
It's going to take
all of my self-control

949
01:37:26.085 --> 01:37:30.445
not to spirit you away to
the Victorian furniture exhibit

950
01:37:30.475 --> 01:37:35.475
so I can make love to you
on one of the four poster beds.

951
01:37:46.235 --> 01:37:48.195
Thank you.

952
01:38:33.535 --> 01:38:35.365
Stunning.

953
01:38:42.205 --> 01:38:44.165
I agree.

954
01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:59.705
Does this please you?

955
01:38:59.725 --> 01:39:01.305
Yes.

956
01:39:11.865 --> 01:39:13.905
You're a work of art.

957
01:39:15.495 --> 01:39:17.745
Happy birthday.

958
01:39:17.995 --> 01:39:19.875
Thank you.

959
01:39:33.465 --> 01:39:35.025
Is this all right?

960
01:39:35.055 --> 01:39:36.805
Don't stop.

961
01:40:09.255 --> 01:40:11.485
Every part of you is perfection,

962
01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.315
but damn...

963
01:40:13.335 --> 01:40:17.695
Professor Emerson,
are you an ass man?

964
01:40:17.715 --> 01:40:19.695
Please don't call me professor.

965
01:40:19.725 --> 01:40:20.365
Why not?

966
01:40:20.385 --> 01:40:23.455
Because I don't want to think
about the university policies

967
01:40:23.475 --> 01:40:25.895
I'm breaking right now.

968
01:40:53.795 --> 01:40:57.175
I'd hardly call this an ass.

969
01:40:57.965 --> 01:41:00.025
I'd have to create
a whole new word

970
01:41:00.055 --> 01:41:03.185
to describe it in all its glory.

971
01:41:17.535 --> 01:41:22.955
Julia... we have to stop.

972
01:41:28.955 --> 01:41:33.215
Your lip is swollen.
I'm sorry.

973
01:41:33.755 --> 01:41:35.105
Does it hurt?

974
01:41:35.135 --> 01:41:38.715
It only aches in your absence.

975
01:41:38.845 --> 01:41:41.015
You're killing me.

976
01:41:41.925 --> 01:41:46.515
But it'll be a sweet,
sweet death.

977
01:42:05.955 --> 01:42:07.175
Don't worry.
I'll get the tape of

978
01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:10.605
our tango against the wall
first thing in the morning.

979
01:42:10.625 --> 01:42:12.295
You better.

980
01:42:19.255 --> 01:42:21.405
It's beautiful.

981
01:42:21.425 --> 01:42:23.595
Happy birthday.

982
01:43:06.935 --> 01:43:09.305
I love it.

01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:46.635
This is the nicest birthday
I've ever had.

984
01:43:53.475 --> 01:43:55.645
And it's not over yet.

985
01:43:56.895 --> 01:43:59.945
Let's start with dessert first.

986
01:44:00.485 --> 01:44:02.045
Chocolate cake.

987
01:44:02.065 --> 01:44:04.825
I'll get the candles.
Don't move.

988
01:44:19.335 --> 01:44:22.885
- Hello.
- Hello, Jules.

989
01:44:26.015 --> 01:44:29.075
How did you get this number,
Simon?
